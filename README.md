# CS-F363
Compiler Construction Group 34

# INSTRUCTIONS (for Linux)

- clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/diveshuttam/CS-F363`
- `cd CS-F363`
- create a folder named `build` in the above directory: `mkdir build` 
- run `make deubg` for running with debug output (runs always automatically with file `a.mylang` to save time during debugging)
- run `make all` for output without debug statements (asks for which file to compile)

# Notes:
 - Remember to free whatever is malloc'ed else  we get random malloc errors
